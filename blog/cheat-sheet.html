  <h1>CSS Cheat Sheet</h1>
  <body>
    <div>
    CSS CHEAT SHEET:
    </div>

    <div>
    SYNTAX
    </div>

    <div>

    COMMENTS IN CSS:
    /* */
    example:/*comment text here*/
    </div>

    <div>

    RELATIVE FONT SIZE:
    use ems (em) instead of pixels (px)
    example: &ltp&gt style="font-size: 1em">One em!&lt/p&gt

    </div>

CSS FONT BACKUP VALUES:
font-family: Tahoma, Verdana, Sans-serif;
note: verdana, sans-serif are backups if Tahoma isn't on computer

CSS CASCADING, OR SELECTING NESTED ELEMENTS:
So what if you want to grab <p>s that are inside 
two <div>s, and not all <p>s?

in CSS, type the following:

div div p {
    property: value;
}

you can also use:

div > p { 
    property: value;
}

This only grabs <p>s that are nested directly inside of <div>s;
it won't grab any paragraphs that are, say, nested inside lists
that are in turn nested inside <div>s.


CSS CLASSES

note: more specific code later down the CSS will override previous, more
generic code.  Example:

p { font-family: Garamond;}
will be overridden by
li p { font-family: Vivaldi}

Classes are assigned to HTML elements with the word class 
and an equals sign, like so:

<div class="square"></div>
<img class="square"/>
<td class="square"></td>

Classes are identified in CSS with a dot (.), like so:

.square {
    height: 100px;
    width: 100px;
}

CSS IDs

IDs, on the other hand, are great for when you have 
exactly one element that should receive a certain kind of styling.

IDs are assigned to HTML elements with the word id and an equals sign:

<div id="first"></div>
<div id="second"></div>
<p id="intro"></p>

IDs are identified in CSS with a pound sign (#):

#first {
    height: 50px;
}

#second {
    height: 100px;


CSS PSEUDO-CLASS SELECTORS

syntax:

selector:pseudo-class_selector {
    property: value;
}

example:

a:hover {
	color: red;
	font-weight: bold;
	text-decoration: none;

this makes it so when you hover your mouse over any link (a),
it turns red and bold

a:link: An unvisited link.
a:visited: A visited link.
a:hover: A link you're hovering your mouse over.


first-child

p:first-child { property: value;}

you can also use "nth-child"

p:nth-child(2) {
    color: red;
}
Would turn every paragraph that is the second child of its parent element red.


CSS BORDER COMMAND WITH MULTIPLE VALUES:
border: 1px solid black;
note: you don't need to put , in between them

CSS TEXT-DECORATION: NONE
note: this removes formatting like the underline and blue on links

CSS TERMS:
MARGIN - space between element and other elements
BORDER
PADDING -space between content and border
CONTENT - text or image

TM - "top margin"
BP - "bottom padding"
LB - "left border"
etc.

CSS MARGIN PROPERTIES
margin: auto
note: this centers the object on the page

margin-top: /*some value*/
margin-right: /*some value*/
margin-bottom: /*some value*/
margin-left: /*some-value*/

You can also set an element's margins all at once: 
you just start from the top margin and go around clockwise 
(going from top to right to bottom to left). For instance:

margin: 1px 2px 3px 4px;

will set a top margin of 1 pixel, a right margin of 2, a bottom of 3, 
and a left of 4.

format: margin: top right bottom left;

PADDING:
padding-top: /*some value*/
padding-right: /*some value*/
padding-bottom: /*some value*/
padding-left: /*some-value*/

or "padding: top right bottom left;

NEGATIVE MARGINS:
If you want to move an element in the other direction, 
you can give CSS a negative value: margin-left: -20px will 
move the element twenty pixels to the left.

CSS WILDCARD or "UNIVERSAL SELECTOR"
if you put "*" before the {, it will apply the property to all selectors


CSS FLOAT
pushes element to the right or left

CSS CLEAR
clear: right - will move below floating elements on the right
clear: left - will move below floating elements on the left
clear: both - will avoid left and right

CSS CENTERING

one way to do this is making the left and right margins "auto"

p {
margin-left: auto;
margin-right: auto;
}

CSS POSITION STATIC
default setting

CSS POSITION: ABSOLUTE
positions element relative to the first parent element that doesn't have
static position

CSS POSITION: RELATIVE
tells the element to move relative to where it would have landed if 
it just had the default static positioning.

CSS POSITION: FIXED
fixed positioning anchors an element to the browser windowâ€”
you can think of it as gluing the element to the screen. 
If you scroll up and down, the fixed element stays put even 
as other elements scroll past.


events
a click is an event
load is an event (when a site finishes loading)

properties
widths, colors etc of objects

methods
methods change the properties of an object when an event happens

CSS STYLING:
border-radius: #px - this makes your buttons or elements have rounded corners
