  <h1>What's the deal with Git, Github, and version control</h1>
  <h2>and why should I care</h2>

      If you're new to programming, you may wonder about the difference between "Git" and "GitHub."  I know I did.  Actually this isn't a case like the whole England/Britain/United Kingdom thing -- where the differences exist but are fuzzy and complicated by the fact that many people use the terms interchangeably.  The difference between Git and GitHub is absolutely crystal clear.  Git is a software program.  It runs on your computer and allows you to do version control when writing code.  What is version control?  Think of it as saved games.  Code can be complicated, and it's easy to mess it up.  If you do mess it up, you can go back to a previous version using Git.  Git also allows you to push changes up for merge into the master code, and track those changes.

      So what is GitHub?  First off, GitHub is awesome.  As opposed to being a software program on your computer, like Git, GitHub is a website that allows for version control among a ton of different people working on the same project.  GitHub can talk to Git on a bunch of different computers if the owners of those computers set up "remotes" which connect their computers to GitHub.  The power of GitHub as a "social coding" site is huge.
