  <h1>CSS Positioning</h1>
  <body>
    <img src="img1.jpg">
    <p>
      All of these elements are in the default position, which is "static."  In other words, none of them have any positioning commands in CSS.

      Here is the HTML and CSS code used to create this page:

        Child2: Kamal is out with twenty men to raise the Border side,<br>
        And he has lifted the Colonel's mare that is the Colonel's pride:<br>
        He has lifted her out of the stable-door between the dawn and the day,<br>
        And turned the calkins upon her feet, and ridden her far away.<br>

        Child3: And this is how I see the East. I have seen its secret places and have looked into its very soul; but now I see it always from a small boat, a high outline of mountains, blue and afar in the morning; like faint mist at noon; a jagged wall of purple at sunset.
