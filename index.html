      <b>Dec 14, 2014: What's the deal with Git, Github, and version control, and why should I care?</b>  
      <br>
      <br>
      If you're new to programming, you may wonder about the difference between "Git" and "GitHub."  I know I did.  Actully this isn't a case like the whole England/Britain/United Kingdom thing -- where the differences exist but are fuzzy and complicated by the fact that many people use the terms interchangeably.  The difference between Git and GitHub is absolutely crystal clear.  Git is a software program.  It runs on your computer and allows you to do version control when writing code.  What is version control?  Think of it as saved games.  Code can be complicated, and it's easy to mess it up.  If you do mess it up, you can go back to a previous version using Git.  Git also allows you to push changes up for merge into the master code, and track those changes.
<br>
<br>
      So what is GitHub?  First off, GitHub is awesome.  As opposed to being a software program on your computer, like Git, GitHub is a website that allows for version control among a ton of different people working on the same project.  GitHub can talk to Git on a bunch of different computers if the owners of those computers set up "remotes" which connect their computers to GitHub.  The power of GitHub as a "social coding" site is huge.

        <b>Dec 14, 2014: Kitchen vs Restaurant</b>
        <br>
        <br>
         Just finished listening to Shereef's fireside chat.  His main point is that students should take a "kitchen," rather than a "restaurant" attitude to Dev BC.  When I read this, I had some idea of what he'd be saying.  He urges students to look at Dev BC not as a consumer good, but as a collaborative learning process.  It's a "you get out what you put in" philosophy.  
    <br>
    <br>
        This is obviously true.  In any learning endeavor, you do get out what you put in.  I'm excited about the kind of environment Shereef describes, where students are extrememly engaged in their learning and take ownership of it.  During my intro session on Google Hangouts, I got really excited during the intro session because all of the other students seemed so interesting and cool.  I think meeting other students is going to be one of the best parts of Dev BC.
    <br>
    <br>
        However, I think the kitchen mentality can go too far.  Ideally I don't think we want kitchen -- I think we want something in between restaurant and kitchen.  Shereef alludes to this also.  The extremes are both undesireable.  On the one hand, you have "full restaurant," where students don't participate, blame the instructors for their lack of effort, and complain about every little thing.  On the other hand, you have a "full kitchen," where Dev BC has outsourced too many curriculum development and learning responsibilities to the students, and students are struggling through learning things inefficiently on their own when some instruction or more refined curriculum would be beneficial.  The instructors respond to all student feedback with "look at it as a kitchen."
   	<br>
    <br>
      I don't think either one of these extremes is actually taking place.  Hopefully Dev BC is somewhere right in the middle, which is where it should be.  Ultimately, student are paying customers and Dev BC is making a profit from them, so it's right that there are some student expectations.  However, students should also realize that their learning will be exponentially better if they invent actively in improving the program and take some ownership of their experience.  If they notice problems in the curriculum, they should put in a little time to help Dev BC improve it.  From what I've observed so far, it seems that this healthy balance is being maintained at Dev BC, and I'm excited to be part of that.

        <b>Dec 30, 2014: CSS Positioning: Relative, Absolute, and Fixed</b>
        <br>
        <br>
         CSS has three positioning functions: Relative, Absolute, and Fixed.  I'll explain each and how they relate to each other.  There is also "static," which is the default position.
         <br>
         <br>
         Relative: this allows you to position an element relative to ITS NORMAL POSITION.  If you just set the position as relative and change nothing else, there will be no change.  However, if you say "top:10px," then the element will move 10px from the top of its NORMAL POSITION.  This is very important.  All of the positioning with the "relative" function is relative to the normal position of the element on the page, as if it were position:static.  When the element is moved out of that position, nothing takes its place.  The other elements on the page act as if it were still in its normal (static) position.  There are two other things that happen when you assign a relative position to an element: (1) relatively positioned elements will also appear on top of all other static elements and (2) all CHILD elements of a relatively positioned element will position themselves within the bounds of that element IF the child elements are given position:absolute.
         <br>
         <br>
         Absolute: "What is absolute?" you might ask.  Position:absolute means that elements are removed from the "flow" of the elements on the page.  They are not affected by other elements nor do they affect elements.  You can use the positioning functions top, bottom, left, and right to give the element an absolute position.  Remember that these elements will position themselves within parent elements
         <br>
         <br>
         Fixed: this is kind of an "old school" command and it isn't often used any longer.  The reason is that it doesn't allow for responsive web design.  One example is if you have a sidebar and the browser window is too small to display the whole thing.  You will not be able to scroll down at all to get to the lower elements on the sidebar.
