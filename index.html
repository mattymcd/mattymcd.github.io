      <b>Dec 14, 2012: What's the deal with Git, Github, and version control, and why should I care?</b>  
      <br>
      <br>
      If you're new to programming, you may wonder about the difference between "Git" and "GitHub."  I know I did.  Actually this isn't a case like the whole England/Britain/United Kingdom thing -- where the differences exist but are fuzzy and complicated by the fact that many people use the terms interchangeably.  The difference between Git and GitHub is absolutely crystal clear.  Git is a software program.  It runs on your computer and allows you to do version control when writing code.  What is version control?  Think of it as saved games.  Code can be complicated, and it's easy to mess it up.  If you do mess it up, you can go back to a previous version using Git.  Git also allows you to push changes up for merge into the master code, and track those changes.
<br>
<br>
      So what is GitHub?  First off, GitHub is awesome.  As opposed to being a software program on your computer, like Git, GitHub is a website that allows for version control among a ton of different people working on the same project.  GitHub can talk to Git on a bunch of different computers if the owners of those computers set up "remotes" which connect their computers to GitHub.  The power of GitHub as a "social coding" site is huge.

        <b>Dec 14, 2012: Kitchen vs Restaurant</b>
        <br>
        <br>
         Just finished listening to Shereef's fireside chat.  His main point is that students should take a "kitchen," rather than a "restaurant" attitude to Dev BC.  When I read this, I had some idea of what he'd be saying.  He urges students to look at Dev BC not as a consumer good, but as a collaborative learning process.  It's a "you get out what you put in" philosophy.  
    <br>
    <br>
        This is obviously true.  In any learning endeavor, you do get out what you put in.  I'm excited about the kind of environment Shereef describes, where students are extrememly engaged in their learning and take ownership of it.  During my intro session on Google Hangouts, I got really excited during the intro session because all of the other students seemed so interesting and cool.  I think meeting other students is going to be one of the best parts of Dev BC.
    <br>
    <br>
        However, I think the kitchen mentality can go too far.  Ideally I don't think we want kitchen -- I think we want something in between restaurant and kitchen.  Shereef alludes to this also.  The extremes are both undesireable.  On the one hand, you have "full restaurant," where students don't participate, blame the instructors for their lack of effort, and complain about every little thing.  On the other hand, you have a "full kitchen," where Dev BC has outsourced too many curriculum development and learning responsibilities to the students, and students are struggling through learning things inefficiently on their own when some instruction or more refined curriculum would be beneficial.  The instructors respond to all student feedback with "look at it as a kitchen."
   	<br>
    <br>
      I don't think either one of these extremes is actually taking place.  Hopefully Dev BC is somewhere right in the middle, which is where it should be.  Ultimately, student are paying customers and Dev BC is making a profit from them, so it's right that there are some student expectations.  However, students should also realize that their learning will be exponentially better if they invent actively in improving the program and take some ownership of their experience.  If they notice problems in the curriculum, they should put in a little time to help Dev BC improve it.  From what I've observed so far, it seems that this healthy balance is being maintained at Dev BC, and I'm excited to be part of that.
